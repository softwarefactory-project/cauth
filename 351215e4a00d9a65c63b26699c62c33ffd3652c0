      "message": "python-cryptography implements signing with padding, which is the right way to do it. However, mod_auth_pubtkt checks signatures without padding (aka \"textbook RSA signature\"), thus always failing the signatures created in cauth.\n\npython-cryptography maintainers do not intend to add support for textbook RSA signature, and mod_auth_pubtkt would require some serious patching to add padding support as per https://mta.openssl.org/pipermail/openssl-users/2017-February/005338.html\n\nGiven that cauth is potentially short lived within SF but some improvements are needed to work on other features, we should go for the simplest solution possible.",
